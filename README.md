Subject: Re: Task Completion 

Dear Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have successfully completed the task you assigned as part of the application process for the React Developer position.

As per your requirements, I have implemented the project using React.js and incorporated the following features and technologies:

1. GSAP and Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
2. Smooth scrolling functionality for enhanced user experience
3. Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling
4. Shadcn UI components for a polished interface

Additionally, I took the initiative to make some minor adjustments to improve the overall aesthetics:

- Modified the background color to enhance visual appeal
- Adjusted the hero page font color for better readability

I believe these changes have resulted in a more attractive and user-friendly interface while still adhering to the core requirements of the task.

I am excited about the opportunity to discuss my implementation in more detail and would be happy to provide any additional information or clarification you may need.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Harsh yadav

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
